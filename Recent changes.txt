Vector drawing commands are now full-blown objects instead of just a bunch of nested arrays.
Each of them is an object of a particular class from the `XFL::Command` module (defined in a separate file).
The coordinates are stored as instance objects of class `Geom::Point` (defined in `geom.rb`).
This facilitates querying these data and comparing them.
Functions from modules `XFL::Edge` and `SVG` has been rewritten to suppor this new format of storing edge data.
Now the outputs from `p` for arrays of commands are a bit more messy.
Nevertheless they are not supposed to be viewed directly, so this is not much a problem.
Maybe I'll add some pretty printer for it in some near future if it will be needed from some reason.
