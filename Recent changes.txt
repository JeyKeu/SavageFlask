Finding filled areas is finally done! :-D
`Symbol#filledRegions` does that by unsharing edges and grouping them by their fill styles.
Then, `Symbol#findContours` is being called on each group of edges having the same fill style on their left.
It calls `Symbol#findContour` to find all segments of the whole closed contour, join them in order, and remove them from the group.
It uses `Symbol#findConnectedTo` to find the index of the next part of the contour in sequence (connected to the contour found so far).

When all closed contours of the filled regions are found, they are converted to SVG paths.

The test code which was no longer necessary has been wiped out from the main source file to clarify it somewhat.

To test how it works, call this script with the first command line parameter set to some XFL file.
Sample test files are stored in `TestData` directory, so you can use those.

Sample SVG file has been merged from the outputs for these XFL test files to show that it really works.
You can find it in `TestOutputs` directory.
Just drag&drop it into your web browser's window to see it.
You should see some parts of Twilight Sparkle's puppet randomly distributed on the SVG canvas.
