Added functions to convert edge data string into an array of commands with operands.
Those functions are:

	cmdToSym(cmdstr)
		Converts XFL vector command into a human-readable symbol (also for efficiency).
	
	hexToNum(hexstr)
		Converts 32-bit fixed-point number from hexadecimal string to its corresponding number.
	
	edgeData2arr(edgeData)
		Reads XFL edge data string into a nested array.
		Numbers are already decoded as floating point values with correct scale.
